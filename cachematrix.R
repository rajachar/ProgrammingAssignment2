## Below are two functions that are used (in its combination) to create a special "matrix" object, calculate its inverse
## (matrix inverse), save / "cache" the same as a variable if it is a new object (i.e, should the object be created 
## for the first time), and merely retrieve it from cache if the object already exists. (without having to redo the same)
##
## The first function, "makeCacheMatrix" creates a special "matrix" object that can "cache" its inverse
##
## This second function, "cacheSolve" computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above

## function - "makeCacheMatrix" 
## Creates a "matrix" object that can be used for caching whenever need arises 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

##
## function - "cacheSolve" 
## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by function "makeCacheMatrix" and "caches" it.
## However, if the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix object has not changed), then this function 
## should just merely retrieve the inverse from the "cache" rather than performing any new calculation(s)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        matrix_inv <- x$getmat_inv()
        if(!is.null(matrix_inv)) {
           message("getting cached data")   # Put out an information message to denote that the object is from cache
           return(matrix_inv)
        }
##
## If the above is TRUE, i.e, the matrix object already exists, the function exits at this point and returns back 
## to the caller with the object just found.
##
## Code continues execution beyond this point if the object is not found (or is NULL). 
##
matrix_x <- x$getmat_x()                # Get the input matrix object
matrix_inv <- solve(matrix_x, ...)      # Calculate the inverse of matrix 
x$setmat_inv(matrix_inv)                # Set the object variable  
return(matrix_inv)                      # return / exit out of the function call with the inverse of the matrix
